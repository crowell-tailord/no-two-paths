                <p>Welcome to No Two Paths!</p>
                <p>This is a beta project built by <a href="https://twitter.com/iam_cro" target="_blank">@crowexx</a>. Updates will be made daily as part of the <a href="https://twitter.com/_buildspace" target="_blank">@buildspace</a> s4 class.</p>
                <p>Currently, the story you'll play has a pre-defined starting point, as well as a pre-defined character. However, once you start the story the options presented to you are all dynamic and unique <em>to you</em>. You will control what you'd like to do in the story.</p>
                <p>As of now, there is no 'end' to the story, so, after several scenes you may find the story getting a little dragged out (not really any point to the options any more). Feel free to just hit the start over button at that point ðŸ˜….. or not and just keep seeing where the story takes you! (However the AI may crap out and you might get an indefinite 'writing...' message.)</p>
                <p>If you're interested in this exact pre-defined storyline, it was actually derived from the <a href="https://twitter.com/thetokyorebels" target="_blank">@Tokyo Rebels</a> NFT project which is still alive and kicking. I took the basis from a puzzle we created there and used it as a starting point here (the profile you see in the game is one of the Rebels!).</p>
